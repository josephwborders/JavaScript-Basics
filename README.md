		        portrait or landscape layout.

Exercise 3.	Write a function that takes an input and returns 'Fizz'
            if the input is a number and divisible by 3, 'Buzz'
            if the input is a number and divisible by 5, 'FizzBuzz'
            if the input is a number and divisible by both 3 and 5,
            returns the original input if it is a number and neither
            divisible by 3 nor 5, or 'Not a number' if the input is
            not a number.

Exercise 10.	Write a function which accepts a number of rows as an argument
              and prints one asterisk on each row, starting with one on line
              one, two on line two, and so on.

Exercise 11.	Write a function which accepts a number as an argument and 
		          returns true if the argument is prime.

	          	returns all the factors of that number (exclusive of n).

Exercise 16.	Write a function to determine the median of 3 numbers.

Exercise 17.	Write a function which accepts two boolean values and returns
	          	true if only one of the values is true.

Exercise 18.	Write a function which accepts two number arguments (k and n)
	          	and returns true if k is a factor of n.

Exercise 19.	Write a function which accepts a number as an argument and
          		returns true if the number is perfect.

              the base-width and height of a triangle, then return the
              triangle area.

Exercise 22.	Write a function which accepts a number as an argument and
	          	determines whether the number is odd or even.

Exercise 23.	Write a function which accepts a letter as an argument and
              returns its numerical value, both as position in the alphabet
              and as unicode.

              a temperature and whether the season is Summer to determine if
              the squirrels are playing in the park. In the Summer, the
